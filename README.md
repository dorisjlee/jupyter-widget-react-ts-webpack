This is an example Jupyter Widget that uses React and is written in Typescript.
The template is largely based off of [widget-ts-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/widget-ts-cookiecutter) and [this](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/issues/2207#issuecomment-422957803) ipywidget issue. 

The main files that differ from `widget-ts-cookiecutter` is  `src/widget.tsx`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `webpack.config.js`.

To get the widget installed, run: 
`sh install.sh`

The widget demonstrates a basic text box input field that dynamically updates based on the Python variable state. This is done via `view.listenTo` in `widget.tsx` that is triggered whenever the object state is changed. In addition, the widget demonstrates how the input field can be propogated to the Python variable state. This is done via `view.model.set` and `view.model.save_changes` (This should ideally be done via `view.touch`.). The basic demo can be found in the `example.ipynb` notebook.
